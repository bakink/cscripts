1. Avoid "ORA-01422: exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows" on 
   SELECT * INTO l_plan_rec FROM dba_cdb_rsrc_plans WHERE plan = k_plan;
   when there has been a prior error that left behind a "pending" area, which
   may cause duplicate rows on dba_cdb_rsrc_plans.

Sets a CDB resource manager that assigns weigthed shares and utilization
limits per PDB.

Shares are between 1 and 10. The most privileged PDB can get up to 10x  
more CPU quantums than the least privileged. Privilege is based on ASH
history, where a 95th PCTL on "ON CPU" and "Scheduler" times are prorated
as per adjusted number of cores. E.g. 36 cores, then 34 adjusted cores,
and PDB has a 95th PCTL of 34 (or higher), then shares becomes 10.

Utlization limits is between 10 and 50 on brakets of 5 (10, 15, ... , 50).
Prorated as per ratio between 99th PCTL of "ON CPU" and "Scheduler" as per
ASH hostory, where if such AAS were equal or larger than adjusted cores 
(e.g. 34) then utlization limit for PDB would be 50. Then, any PDB could
consume up to 50% of the resources (cpu_count) assigned to database.
